# Overview

Welcome to the Safient protocol documentation 👋

:::note what is Safient?

Safient proposes an intuitive solution to this critical problem with a mechanism to securely manage all the secrets through Safient safes that can be recovered or inherited during claimable events without any intermediaries or custody. Safient is a trustless protocol, meaning that there is no need to necessarily trust any actors while using the solution.
