## What is Asguard?

Asaguard is a plug and play solution for DApps and wallet providers to quickly create a smart contract wallet leveraging account abstraction to provide whole bunch of features that provides security and best user experience.

Asguard provides the easiest way to create a wallet with easy onboarding and yet provides the best recovery solution to ensure that the user always retains control of the wallet.

Unlike existing non-custodial wallets, the user doesnâ€™t need to back up their wallet seed phrases while creating the account. In case of loss of access to the wallet, it can be self-recovered or claimed by beneficiaries at the right time without any intermediaries. 

The wallet users can add a recovery mechanism and beneficiary at any time. This enables the wallet to be self-recovered anytime by the creator and claimed by the beneficiary only during certain events.
