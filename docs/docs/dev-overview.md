# Build on Safient

This section will help quickly get started if you are looking to build an application using Safient protocol or trying to integrate an existing application.


## Where to begin?

All the required functionalities from creating a user to claiming a created safe can be found in our [Safient Core](./core-getting-started) library.

Get started with [Safient Core here](./core-getting-started)

:::info Safient Contracts

Safient core internally performs onchain interactions using smart contracts via
[Safient Contracts](https://contracts.safient.io/) library. You can also interact with them direcrtly if you desire but we highly recommend using `[Safient Core](./core-getting-started) directly.
